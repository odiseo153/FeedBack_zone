# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements comprehensive multilingual support for the web application, enabling users to dynamically switch between different languages for static interface components. The solution will support Spanish, Chinese (Simplified Mandarin), French, German, and Portuguese (Brazilian) with real-time language switching capabilities, efficient translation management, and adherence to internationalization best practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to dynamically switch the application language through a user interface component, so that I can use the application in my preferred language without page reloads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on the language selector THEN the system SHALL display available language options (Spanish, Chinese Simplified, French, German, Portuguese Brazilian)
2. WHEN a user selects a different language THEN the system SHALL update all static interface text immediately without page reload
3. WHEN a user switches languages THEN the system SHALL persist the language preference for future sessions
4. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display content in the user's previously selected language or default to English

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an efficient translation management system, so that I can easily maintain and update translations for all supported languages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN translations are needed THEN the system SHALL store translation keys and values in structured JSON files organized by language
2. WHEN a translation key is missing THEN the system SHALL fall back to the default language (English) and log the missing translation
3. WHEN new translation keys are added THEN the system SHALL support nested key structures for organized translation management
4. WHEN translations are updated THEN the system SHALL hot-reload translations in development mode

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want dates, numbers, and currency to be formatted according to my selected language and region, so that the information is displayed in a familiar format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying dates THEN the system SHALL format them according to the selected language's locale conventions
2. WHEN displaying numbers THEN the system SHALL use appropriate decimal separators and thousand separators for the selected locale
3. WHEN displaying currency THEN the system SHALL format amounts using the appropriate currency symbol and positioning for the locale
4. WHEN displaying time THEN the system SHALL use 12-hour or 24-hour format based on locale preferences

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the multilingual system to be scalable, so that I can easily add new languages without significant code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding a new language THEN the system SHALL only require creating a new translation file and adding the language to the configuration
2. WHEN new translation keys are introduced THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and handle them across all language files
3. WHEN the language list is updated THEN the system SHALL dynamically populate the language selector without code changes
4. WHEN extending functionality THEN the system SHALL provide reusable translation hooks and utilities

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want dynamic content from APIs to also support translation, so that all application content is available in my selected language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API responses contain translatable content THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms to translate dynamic text
2. WHEN server-side translations are needed THEN the system SHALL support backend translation capabilities
3. WHEN mixed static and dynamic content is displayed THEN the system SHALL handle both translation types seamlessly
4. WHEN translation keys are embedded in API responses THEN the system SHALL resolve them to translated text

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to handle text direction and layout considerations, so that the application works correctly for different writing systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a right-to-left language is selected THEN the system SHALL support RTL text direction (future consideration for Arabic/Hebrew)
2. WHEN text direction changes THEN the system SHALL adjust layout components appropriately
3. WHEN displaying mixed-direction content THEN the system SHALL handle bidirectional text correctly
4. WHEN language affects layout THEN the system SHALL provide CSS utilities for direction-aware styling

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and debugging capabilities, so that I can quickly identify and resolve translation issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN translation keys are missing THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including the missing key and context
2. WHEN translation loading fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to default language with error logging
3. WHEN development mode is active THEN the system SHALL provide visual indicators for missing translations
4. WHEN translation errors occur THEN the system SHALL not break the user interface functionality
